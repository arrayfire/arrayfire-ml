#ArrayFire ML


ArrayFire ML is a C and C+++ machine learning library built on top of the [ArrayFire library](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire). This library leverages arrayfire's cross platform support to provide high performance machine learning algorithms for multi-core CPUs, NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and other accelerators.
